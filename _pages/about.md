## About Me  

My name is Yangge Xiao (肖杨格 in Chinese). I'm currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at National University of Singapore. I am advised by Zhenyu Hu and Gar Goei Loke. My research focuses on mechanism and information design, understanding how to use monetary rewards or information to reduce efficiency loss in presence of information asymmetry and mitigate interest misalignment due to dynamic interaction among game participants.
