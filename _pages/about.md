<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>
Hi, I'm Guang Cheng! I'm currently a second-year Ph.D. student at National University of Singapore.
I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.joelgoh.net/" target="_blank" style="color: black">Joel Goh</a>.
My primary research interests are in data-driven modeling and empirical analysis with applications in healthcare operations management and medical decision making.
